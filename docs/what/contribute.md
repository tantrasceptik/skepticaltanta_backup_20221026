The Skeptical Tantra website is built in a collaborative way thanks to [GitHub](https://github.com/) in order to allow everyone to propose modifications to the website and to create their own version of Tantra Between Skeptics.

Concretely, at the bottom of each page of this website, you have a link **Edit this page** on which you can click to propose a modification via [GitHub](https://github.com/).

[This documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) explains how to create an account on GitHub.

If you don't know [GitHub](https://github.com/), you can read [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-github/2-what-is-github).

Also, if you want to:

1. discuss more generally about Skeptical Tantra
1. make suggestions
1. give criticism
1. have trouble using [GitHub](https://github.com/)

you can contact us on the [private Facebook group of Skeptical Tantra](https://www.facebook.com/groups/curious.people.skeptical.tantra).
