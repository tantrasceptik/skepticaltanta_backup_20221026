## Definitions

### Definition 1

Skeptic Tantra is an experimentation around group effects and/or touch, between consenting adults who respect a [code of conduct](ethical/ethical-code-of-conduct.md).

This framework allows people to experiment with a range of situations, in order to have a better control of their own body in these situations, notably situations around the management of desire.

### Definition 2

Implementation of framed practices which aim to secure the experimentation of sensations in a relational framework, and which it is possible to testify to by using non-prescriptive vocabulary.

## History

Tantra between Skeptics was born following the meeting of a dozen Skeptical Tantrikas who have been exploring Neo-Tantra for years underwater, and who feel that New Age beliefs are a brake on developing the potential of what has been discovered by the Neo-Tantrikas through Tantric practices.

In addition, the COVID-19 health crisis has been the trigger for promoting Skepticism and Zetetics within the Neo-Tantric community.

## Why "Tantra"?

Because most of the exercises in Tantra between Skeptics are largely inspired by Neo-Tantra practices, which are mainly based on New Age beliefs to justify their exercises.

## Why "Skeptic"?

To explain the practices from the most scientific point of view possible, based in particular on [scientific skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism)

It is a current of thought, called skepticism or zetetics, which studies paranormal phenomena using the scientific method and also a militant movement for the promotion of critical thinking and scientific pedagogy.
