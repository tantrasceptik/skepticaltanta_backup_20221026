## Why did you call the "Tantra between Skeptics" like that? Wouldn't it be better to remove the word "Tantra" from the name?

1. The approach behind the **Tantra between Skeptics** is similar to those of [ZETETIC GAMERS](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ZETETICGAMERS), [Zet && TIC](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zet.tic) or even [Zet hammers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/294521008405129), i.e. Skeptics/Zeteticians who gather around a theme.
In our case, it is the experimentation around the touch, while being inspired by practices coming from the Neo-Tantra, while excluding any form of spirituality or New Age explanation like the chakras.
1. The majority of Tantra practices among Skeptics come from Neo-Tantra. We do not deny this inspiration.
1. The word **Tantra** is already known to the general public, especially through the women's press, of which here is a sample:

1. To allow some believers in the New Age to eventually get interested in skepticism
1. To allow beginners in Tantra to hear another side to the explanations given, which are not explanations that come from New Age beliefs
1. Last but not least, some of the skeptical community is very quick to judge a practice by its name alone, and this is not really a recommended attitude in the practice of skepticism. It is a good practical exercise for the Skeptical community to dig before judging.

## I have met someone who claims to organize "Skeptic Tantra" workshops or someone who offers to train me, how can I trust them?

Currently, the Skeptical Tantrikas behind this initiative do not organize workshops or trainings.
This website will be updated as developments on this issue occur.

## After reading this website, I would like to organize "Tantra between Skeptics" workshops, how can I be recognized?

Same answer as the previous question.

## How can I contact the people behind this initiative?

The easiest way is via [the chat on our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/tantra.entre.sceptiques/).

Attention, we are volunteers, we take time to answer.
