| New Age | Skeptic |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Chakras      | From a purely anatomical point of view, Chakras do not exist. However, the symbolism of the Chakras is used by Neo-Tantra believers as a symbol to talk about their problems and successes. For example, talking about their heart chakra when they are having problems with love. |
| Sexual Energy | Primarily represents sexual desire |
| Kundalini | Seems to refer to self-induced sensations similar to Pavlov's reflexes. The brain has a great capacity to generate phantom sensations. |
| Lingam | male reproductive system |
|Cellular memory | According to New Age beliefs, psychological traumas are stored in cells. If from a scientific point of view, this seems unlikely, this understanding in the New Age seems rather to result from a misunderstanding of the human body on their part, especially concerning the recording of traumas in the human brain |
| Vibratory rate | This is another way of talking about one's own mood or intuition when meeting other people. Can be self-induced sensations |
| Yin and Yang | List of attributes normally associated with women (Yin) and men (Yang) according to the patriarchy, for example: Soft, fragile... for Yin and strong, fast... for Yang. for the Yang. On the other hand, in the Neo-Tantra, they consider that every human being contains Yin and Yang, so a person of the female gender can include more "Yang" than "Yin". The gender is decoupled from the Yin and Yang. |
| Yoni | female genitalia |
