Skeptical Tantra would be nothing without all the volunteers who work behind the scenes to experiment, manage this community, produce content on this website, and most importantly, review.

We thank as much the people who are in a spiritual tantra approach and who have enough open-mindedness to read and propose suggestions for improvements, even if they do not approve of the content, as the skeptics who have not forgotten the original goal of Skepticism, and know how to go beyond the lexical field of the New-Age.

**So, BEWARE: Some of the proofreaders disagree with the content of this website, but they have been open-minded enough to proofread it.
We would ask you to avoid dishonor by association and targeted harassment, especially of those who are on a spiritual journey. Thank you.**
