To practice in a skeptical setting where pseudo-science and fakemeds will be kept out of the discussion, and where it is possible to talk about critical thinking as well as skepticism and zetetics with people who are curious to experiment with touch.

In addition, perhaps some of the exercises proposed by Neo-Tantra might be interesting to study, especially since they are not practiced outside of Neo-Tantra to our knowledge.

Because there are Skeptics who practice Tantra: so that they can find a protected space to discuss their practices.
