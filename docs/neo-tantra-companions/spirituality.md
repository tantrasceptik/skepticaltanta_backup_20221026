New Age spirituality](/docs/what/what-is-new-age) has a central place in the Tantra community, in order to provide a framework and explanation for the phenomena experienced during a Tantra session.

Even if the main goal of the initiative "Skeptical Tantra" is to produce content about Tantra free of any spirituality and based on scientific knowledge, which can be qualified as secular Tantra, the collective "Skeptical Tantra" respects **all** forms of religion and spirituality, we do not have the mission to change the modelling of the world of neo-tantrikas.

On the other hand, we note that a majority of Skeptics/Zetetists are atheists or agnostics, which could give the impression that spirituality is not compatible with skepticism.

We feel that a process of meta-cognition as well as deconstruction of magical thinking can lead to a move away from spirituality or religion, even if it is not mandatory.

Moreover, from our point of view, as much as it seems important to define one's own ethics, we understand that a majority of Sceptics are atheists or agnostics, by making good use of the knowledge of the scientific and Sceptic community.

For the moment, we have no one in the collective who is in a spirituality or religion, nevertheless, these people are welcome, as long as they are sincere in their Skeptical approach.
