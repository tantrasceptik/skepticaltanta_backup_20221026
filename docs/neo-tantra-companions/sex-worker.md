For the general public, there is confusion between tantric masseuses and sex workers, when there are two very different aspects to consider:

Tantric masseuses & masseurs who respect the tantric philosophy do not have sex with their clients, because these people adhere to a number of prohibitions such as the prohibition of kissing, or even sexual intercourse.

However, what maintains the confusion is that some TDS master tantric practices and the word "tantra" is used as a commercial argument to justify a more expensive rate.

Although there may be some similarities between sex and tantric massage, as both can give desire and pleasure, the sensations experienced during sex and tantric massage are very different, not least because the person being massaged is doing almost nothing: it is not a two-way exchange of touch, but one person receives the touch while the other gives it.

The intention behind a tantric massage is also different from sexual intercourse.
