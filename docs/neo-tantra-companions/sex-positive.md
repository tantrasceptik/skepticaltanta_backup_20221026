The values behind Sex-Positive are very close to those of Tantric Skeptics, especially through their [code of conduct](https://sex-positive.com/codeofconduct/)

Some of the Skeptical Tantrikas are also part of the Sex-Positive movement.

However, Sex-Positive includes a whole range of practices and experiments such as [BDSM](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/BDSM) whereas Tantra between Sceptics focuses on Tantra.
