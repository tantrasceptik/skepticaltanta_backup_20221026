## Important note

Even if the practices in classical Tantra (except sexual Tantra) have a low risk of transmission of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), nevertheless, it seemed important to us to provide information on sexual health.

Indeed, it is a common belief in the Neo-Tantra community that spirituality protects against STIs.

Unfortunately, it seems highly unlikely that spirituality can have any impact on protection against STIs.

## Risks with STIs

You should be aware of burning while urinating, vaginal discharge, pimples, warts or sores on the sexual organs, and itching.

Also, be aware that a majority of STIs have no symptoms, so in any case, if you are sexually active or active, screening is very important to do at least once in your life.

Almost all STIs, except [HIV](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html), have effective treatments, if and only if you are regularly screened in specialized places and treated, because some STIs can become dangerous over the years (cancer...).

If you change partners regularly, screening every 6 months is a reasonable time frame.

## Good practices to avoid the transmission of germs

### Tantra exercises

1. 1. [Wash your hands well](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/lang/when-how-handwashing.html) before practicing as well as after practicing.
1. Have good personal hygiene (shower).

### Tantric Massage

1. [Wash your hands well](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/lang/when-how-handwashing.html) before and after the massage, as well as between two massages of different people.
1. Cut your nails before the massage.
1. Have good personal hygiene (shower) before a massage.
1. Look at your hands and identify if there are any unhealed cuts.

### Sexual relations with a casual partner

1. Use a condom, the only effective protection against most STIs.
2. If Tantric massage is a preliminary to penetrative sex, avoid oiling the genitals, especially the inside of the vagina, otherwise the condom is likely to crack.
3. Even if there is less risk, fellatio and cunnilingus have risks of STI transmission.

### Sex with a regular partner

To stop using condoms safely, two things are essential:

1. The trust of intimate exclusivity.
2. Get tested 6 weeks after defining intimate exclusivity between partners, as it takes 6 weeks before HIV infection can be detected.
