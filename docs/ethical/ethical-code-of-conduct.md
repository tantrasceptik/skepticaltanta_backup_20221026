## 1. Have a good body hygiene

It is very important to clean all parts of the body with soap and to brush your teeth before any practice. In addition, it is highly recommended to wash your hands every time you change partners.

## 2. Respect each other and their limits

Throughout the experimentation, it is essential to respect everyone's limits, especially by taking the time to get everyone's consent.

If at any time someone feels uncomfortable in the experimentation, he or she can express it without fear of breaking the group dynamic. Moreover, each participant is invited to observe the others and to ask if everything is going well in case someone seems to be having a hard time with the experiment.

If someone is pushing you to go outside the box, especially an authority figure such as a trainer, then it is best to ask the person to respect the boundaries, or even stop the collaboration if a need for safety is not heard.

## 3. Do not use any substance that impairs judgment

In order to obtain consent in good conditions, no legal or illegal substances, such as alcohol, drugs, medications, mushrooms... should be taken.

This is to ensure that the consent obtained is as informed as possible.

## 4. Definition and respect of the framework

Before starting the experiment, define a **clear** and **explicit** framework for each participant.

**Example**: You can touch my head, but not my hair.

This common framework is defined by all the participants and respected throughout the experimentation.

This framework can evolve during the experimentation, as long as all the participants agree to transform it.

On the other hand, one person is sufficient to decide to narrow the framework of the experimentation and everyone must then respect this new framework.

## 5. No goals

Perhaps one of the most difficult points to reach in Tantra between Skeptics, to be able to let go without any particular objective during the experimentation.

## 6. Suspending judgment

Everyone has their own limits and their own representation of the world, an experiment that may seem simple to us may be very complicated to do for another person.

Example: Undressing in front of someone else

## 7. Humility

Even after years of experience in Tantra between Skeptics, it is essential to remain humble, because each person and each experience is unique, it is impossible to anticipate how the other will experience it.

## 8. Avoid relationships with a dominance/submission relationship

Dominant/submissive relationships may be present between people who experience Tantra among skeptics.

Even if this dominance/submission relationship is between consenting individuals, it is even more important to validate that this dominance/submission relationship does not alter the decision to consent.

## 9. Rejecting sexual and gender-based violence

The content of this website can be hijacked by sexual predators in order to commit sexual violence, it is important to underline this and to remind again that it is extremely important to set the framework before practicing as well as to respect the framework during the practice, as defined in point 2.

## 10. Transmission of reliable knowledge

The knowledge that circulates among Skepticals Tantrikas tries to keep up with the latest scientific knowledge and to identify existing beliefs, knowing that there are still few scientific studies in the field.
