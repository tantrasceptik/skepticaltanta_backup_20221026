If you already practice Tantra and/or Tantric massage, especially with a spiritual approach based on the chakras, then chances are that the content of this website will not speak to you. On the other hand, if you have very rational, very Yang friends who do not believe in your vision of energetics, but you would like them to understand a little better what Tantra is, then you may be in the right place:

Indeed, the purpose of this website is to try to build a bridge between the practices promoted by Tantra and try to bring them closer to Science, in order to provide content that is understandable by people who do not have the vocabulary usually used in Tantra and / or who are not in search of spirituality.

For this reason, this website proposes alternative explanations to those promoted in Tantra, replacing the explanations based on New Age spirituality with explanations that use a scientific lexical field, so that these people, reassured by explanations that use a vocabulary that is familiar to them, may want to experience Tantra.

Some information may be contrary to popular belief in Tantra, or even cause cognitive dissonance for spiritual Tantrikas, we are sincerely sorry, this is not the intention, there is no obligation to adhere to the information on this website, and it is highly likely that errors or misinterpretations are present.

Please welcome this website with kindness and non-judgment, as proposed by the Tantra philosophy.
